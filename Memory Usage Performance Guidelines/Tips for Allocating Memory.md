# Tips for Allocating Memory 分配内存的技巧
Memory is an important resource for your application so it’s important to think about how your application will use memory and what might be the most efficient allocation approaches. Most applications do not need to do anything special; they can simply allocate objects or memory blocks as needed and not see any performance degradation. For applications that use large amount of memory, however, carefully planning out your memory allocation strategy could make a big difference.

The following sections describe the basic options for allocating memory along with tips for doing so efficiently. To determine if your application has memory performance problems in the first place, you need to use the Xcode tools to look at your application’s allocation patterns while it is running. For information on how to do that, see [Tracking Memory Usage](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Performance/Conceptual/ManagingMemory/Articles/FindingPatterns.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001882-CJBJFIDD).
